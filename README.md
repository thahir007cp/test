My First Github Test Project

This repository contains a simple React application. Open `index.html` in your
browser to see it in action.

## Node setup

If you have internet access, run `npm install` to fetch dependencies defined in
`package.json`. You can then run `npm test` (which currently prints an error as
there are no tests).
